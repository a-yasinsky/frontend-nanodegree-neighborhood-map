## Instalation
1. Download the GitHub zip file or clone the repository onto your local workstation: 
	* [zip file](https://github.com/a-yasinsky/frontend-nanodegree-neighborhood-map/archive/master.zip)
	* [git clone](https://github.com/a-yasinsky/frontend-nanodegree-neighborhood-map.git)
2. Open a browser window and navigate to the index.html file

## APIs:
* [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/developer/index.htm)
* [Numbeo](https://www.numbeo.com/api/doc.jsp)

###Glassdoor
Because the Glassdoor's API does not provide salary data devided by cities, data parse form [salary page](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/company-salaries.htm) with POST parametrs. And the cityId could be found from [autocomplete method](https://www.glassdoor.com/findPopularLocationAjax.htm) on the main page.
Sometim it works with trouble, but it is good for Error Handling.

###Numbeo
Use method GET /api/indices
Description: Returns Numbeo's indices for a city. Location can be specified with a query containing name or latitude,longitude (with comma separator).
